## Requirements
This app requires a development account, which can be freely obtained from https://www.miele.com/f/com/en/register_api.aspx with your email-address and a application name.

## Adding devices
Although intriguing, I don't own all devices that can be controlled through Miele@Home

## Capabilities
Miele has published a spreadsheet containing all the capabilities of each device. This file can be found on [miele.com/developer](https://www.miele.com/developer/assets/API_V1.x.x_capabilities_by_device.pdf).

- Washing Machine
